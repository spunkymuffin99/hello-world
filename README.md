Obviously I am interested in Bitcoin.  You should be too.  Bitcoin is going to become the dominant form of money in the entire would.  It is the prestine asset since it cannot be printed by any government.  I would never give up my bitcoin to my government specifically because they try to control the world by printing their Monopoly money.  I believe the govenment is the problem, not the solution, to most of the world's problems.
